## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm Ilenyd Bravo Guzmán, an economist with over three years of experience in applied research, particularly in education and gender. I currently work as a Senior Research Analyst at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), where I support the design, implementation, and analysis of rigorous impact evaluations aimed at improving public policy.

I believe that **more evidence leads to a better quality of life**. My goal is to contribute to data-driven policy decisions by generating reliable evidence in collaboration with leading researchers and policymakers.
